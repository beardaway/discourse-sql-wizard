Are you a developer community engineer? Or maybe a developer community lead? Doesn't matter! If you're using Discourse as your main platform for hosting your company developer forum, for sure sooner or later you will be using the Data Explorer plugin! This repo is your place for finding useful queries. **Simply go to Queries folder!**

### Data Explorer 

Data Explorer is a Discourse plugin for running SQL queries against your database, allowing for instant stats reporting.

* **What does it do?**
  * Data explorer allows you to run read-only queries against your live site database. Data explorer provides access to all database tables, supporting queries on any data stored by your site. Queries are written using standard SQL, allowing any DB expert to create a query. Once written, queries can be run directly inside Discourse, or triggered via the API by an external application.

* **How do I use it?**
  * To use Data Explorer the plugin must first be enabled via site settings. Next, navigate to Data Explorer via the Admin plugins page. Queries can then be created from scratch, or imported from a json file.
